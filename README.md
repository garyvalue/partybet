# Project Overview:
## Partybet is a telegram group-based luck-based red envelope bot. It features two gameplay modes:
1.Decentralized Telegram Group Red Envelope Game: Friends within the group compete to guess the next hourly BTC price. Each participant submits 0.008 ETH as a bet. When the hour strikes, the person closest to the actual price wins the entire ETH reward pool. In case of a tie, the prize pool is split evenly.
<br> 
2.Jackpot Red Envelope Pool: Participants can submit 0.008 ETH as a bet into the project's jackpot pool. When the hour strikes, the person with the closest guess wins the entire ETH reward pool. In the event of a tie, the prize pool is distributed equally.

## Project Features:
  1.Utilizes Telegram Group and Bot Interaction: Low entry barriers for users, fostering viral growth through easy access.
  <br> 
  2.Fair and Engaging Guessing Mechanism: Ensures fairness and participant engagement, creating addictive and sticky user experiences.
  <br> 
  3.Low Entry Capital with High Return Potential: Both Web2 and Web3 users can participate with minimal financial requirements, providing high liquidity for Web3 adoption.
  <br> 
  4.Versatile Mechanism with Strong Scalability: Beyond a gaming platform, it holds potential as a community service tool, a project marketing instrument, and could evolve into a decentralized exchange with stacked tokenomics.
